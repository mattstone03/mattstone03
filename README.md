- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattstone03

- 👀 I’m a fine artist living and working in Brooklyn NY. Im 42 y o, and interested in what a carear change into software development could be like.  
- 🌱 I’m tring to deside if its a good fit for me, if I could have the aptitude for it and if I like it enough to make a real comitment and join a boot camp.
- 💞️ Are there any artists that have done this leap into the disaplin?
